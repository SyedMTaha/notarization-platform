## Problems - RESOLVED
1. ✅ **Add tailwind `important`** - Added tailwind.config.js with `important: true` setting
2. ✅ **Mobile logos quality poor** - Created optimized Logo component with responsive sizing and image quality improvements
3. ~~N/A~~ - Placeholder removed
4. ~~Updating (Not important)~~ - Deferred
