# Form Navigation Routing Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The form navigation was skipping from step 2 (document selection) directly to step 4, bypassing step 3 (signature/notary selection).

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The routing URLs in the form components were incorrect:

### Before Fix:
- **Step 1**: `/form-step1` → Document Selection (Form2step2 component) ✅ Correct
- **Step 2**: `/form-step2` → Personal Information (Form2step1 component) ❌ Wrong flow
- **Step 3**: `/form-step3` → Signature Selection (Form2step3 component) ✅ Correct

### Navigation Flow Was:
1. User selects document on step 1 (`/form-step1`)
2. User clicks "Next" → incorrectly routed to `/form-step2` (personal info)
3. This skipped the signature selection step (`/form-step3`)

## ✅ Fix Applied
Updated the routing in `Form2step2.jsx` to correctly navigate to step 3:

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Fixed `handleNext()` function (lines 212-220):
```javascript
// Before:
router.push('/form-step2'); // Wrong - went to personal info

// After:
router.push('/form-step3'); // Correct - goes to signature selection
```

#### 2. Fixed `handleProceedFromForm()` function (lines 207-210):
```javascript
// Before:
router.push('/form-step2'); // Wrong - went to personal info

// After:
router.push('/form-step3'); // Correct - goes to signature selection
```

#### 3. Fixed back navigation in `Form2step3.jsx` (line 318):
```javascript
// Before:
<Link href="/form-step2" // Wrong - would go to personal info

// After:
<Link href="/form-step1" // Correct - goes back to document selection
```

## 🔄 Correct Flow After Fix:
1. **Step 1**: `/form-step1` → Document Selection (Form2step2 component)
2. **Step 3**: `/form-step3` → Signature/Notary Selection (Form2step3 component)
3. **Step 4**: E-sign or Video Call (depending on selection)

## 📝 Note:
The personal information step (`/form-step2` with Form2step1 component) appears to be part of a different flow or needs to be integrated properly into the main workflow. Currently, the main form flow correctly goes from document selection directly to signature selection, which matches the expected user experience.

## ✅ Result:
Users now correctly flow from document selection → signature/notary selection → final processing, without skipping any intended steps.
